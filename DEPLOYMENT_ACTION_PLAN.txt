## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Free Tier Limitations
- **Render:** Backend spins down after 15 min of inactivity
  - First request = ~30 sec startup time
  - Then normal speed
  - Solution: Upgrade to $7/mo to disable
  
- **Vercel:** Limited to 12 serverless functions
  - Should not affect this dashboard
  - Plenty of free tier resources

### Performance
- Small delays on first load after idle
- This is normal and free
- Upgrade if 24/7 instant access needed

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### Backend Won't Deploy
```
✓ Check Render logs (Render Dashboard → Service → Logs)
✓ Ensure all environment variables are set
✓ Verify root directory is "backend"
✓ Try redeploy from Render dashboard
```

### Frontend Won't Deploy
```
✓ Check Vercel logs (Vercel Dashboard → Deployments)
✓ Verify VITE_API_URL is set
✓ Ensure root directory is "frontend"
✓ Try rebuilding deployment
```

### "Cannot Connect to Backend"
```
✓ Wait 5 minutes for Render to stabilize
✓ Check that backend URL is correct in frontend
✓ Test health endpoint: https://your-backend/api/health
✓ Hard refresh frontend: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

### Map Not Showing (Technicians Page)
```
✓ Backend still deploying (wait 5 min)
✓ Check browser console for errors (F12)
✓ Verify CORS is not blocking requests
```
